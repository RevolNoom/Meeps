For the first 4 test cases (Before Black belt), we'll do three separate tests on each of NAIVE, SQUARE, and SIMPSON:
* Even division (all dx are equals), integrates from left to right.
* Even division, integrates from right to left.
* Sloppily Small (the nearer x is to 0, the smaller each dx is), integrates from right to left.

Easy peasy: 

	1. a = 0, b = 2, n = 10 (Example test case)
	VINACAL ES 570 PLUS: 4.428594871
	integral-calculator: 4.428594871176362

	2. a = 0, b = 4, n = 20 (Project requirement's maximum constraint)

The bugs are coming out: 

	3. a = 0, b = 0.01, n = 1000 
	VINACAL ES 570 PLUS: 0.03999866675
	integral-calculator: 0.03999866674666095

	4. a = 0, b = 100, n = 10000 (About 20s, I did this in 15s)

Black-belt level: 

	a = 0, b = 1e9
	5. n = 1e5 
	6. n = 1e6 (I guess it'll be about 3 minutes?)

Covid-19: (I need a microscope!)
	a = 0, b = 1
	7. n = 10
	8. n = 1000
	9. n = 1e5
	VINACAL ES 570 PLUS: 4x10^(-7)
